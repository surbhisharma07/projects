<p style="color:yellow; font-family:Castellar;font-size:26px"align="center"><u>Brief Discription of the guitars shown above</u></p>
<ul>
<a id="a"><li p style="font-size:18px;color:white"><u>Accoustic Guitar</u> :- An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acoustically—by transmitting the vibration of the strings to the air—as opposed to relying on electronic amplification (see electric guitar). The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings.</li></a>

<li p style="font-size:18px;color:white"><a id="b"><u>Bass Guitar </u>:- The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four to six strings or courses. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). The bass guitar is a transposing instrument, as it is notated in bass clef an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive ledger lines. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar has pickups and needs to be connected to an amplifier and speaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear.</li></a>

<li p style="font-size:18px;color:white"><a id="c"><u>Classic Guitar</u>  :-  The classical guitar (also known as concert guitar, classical acoustic, nylon-string guitar, or Spanish guitar) is the member of the guitar family used in classical music. It is an acoustical wooden guitar with strings made of nylon, rather than the metal strings used in acoustic and electric guitars. The traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the soundhole (this is called the classical position). The modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see Dreadnought) and is commonly played off the hip.

The phrase "classical guitar" may refer to either of two concepts other than the instrument itself:

the instrumental finger technique common to classical guitar—individual strings plucked with the fingernails or, rarely, fingertips.</li></a><br>

<a id="abf"><li p style="font-size:18px;color:white"><a id="d"><u>Steel Guitar </u> :-  Steel guitar is a type of guitar or the method of playing the instrument. Developed in Hawaii in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a steel guitar is usually positioned horizontally; strings are plucked with one hand, while the other hand changes the pitch of one or more strings with the use of a bar or slide called a steel (generally made of metal, but also of glass or other materials). The earliest use of an electrified steel guitar was first made in the early 1930s by Bob Dunn of Milton Brown and His Brownies, a western swing band from Fort Worth, Texas; the instrument was perfected in the mid to late 1930s by Fort Worth's Leon McAluff, who played for western swing band Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. Nashville later picked up the use of the steel guitar in the early days of the late 1940s and early 1950s "Honky Tonk" country & western music with a number of fine steel guitarists backing names like Hank Williams, Lefty Frizell and Webb Pierce.</li></a>

<li p style="font-size:18px;color:white"><a id="e"><u>Archtop guitar</u>  :- An archtop guitar is a hollow steel-stringed acoustic or semi-acoustic guitar with a full body and a distinctive arched top, whose sound is particularly popular with jazz, blues, rockabilly and psychobilly guitarists.

Typically, an archtop guitar has:

6 strings
An arched top and back, not a flat top and back
A hollow body                                                      
Moveable adjustable bridge
F-holes similar to members of the violin family
Rear mounted tailpiece, stoptail bridge or Bigsby tremolo
14th-fret neck join</li></a>

<li p style="font-size:18px;color:white"><a id="f"><u>Parlour Guitar </u>  :- Parlor guitar has also come to denote a style of American guitar music from the 19th and early 20th centuries.[citation needed] Noted composers include William Foden, Winslow Hayden, William Bateman, Justin Holland, and Wilhelm Bischoff. The music for the guitar includes a variety of dance forms (waltz, schottische, polka), instrumental arrangements of popular songs, guitar arrangements of then popular classical music, operatic arrangements and music from European guitar composers (Sor, Giuliani, Carcassi, Coste and Mertz). The Scruggs style and its banjo rolls are based upon and contemporary with parlor-style guitar.</li></a>
